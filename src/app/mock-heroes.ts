    shortBio: 'Sent as a baby to Earth from the dying planet Krypton,\n' +
    '        Kal-El was adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent of Smallville,\n' +
    '        Kansas. Growing up as Clark Kent, he devoted his life to helping\n' +
    '        others with the abilities he developed from Earth\'s sun. Moving to\n' +
    '        Metropolis, he became Superman, while still maintaining his\n' +
    '        secret identity as Clark Kent, who works at the Daily Planet newspaper.',
    bio: 'In the original Siegel and Shuster stories, Superman\'s personality is ' +
    'rough and aggressive. He was seen stepping in to stop wife beaters, ' +
    'profiteers, a lynch mob and gangsters, with rather rough edges and a looser moral ' +
    'code than we may be used to today. In later adventures he became, softer, and ' +
    'had more of a sense of idealism and moral code of conduct. Although not as ' +
    'cold-blooded as the early Batman, the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s ' +
    'is unconcerned about the harm his strength may cause, tossing villainous characters ' +
    'in such a manner that fatalities would presumably occur, although these were ' +
    'seldom shown explicitly on the page. This came to an end when Superman vowed never to take a life.' +
    '+\n' +
    'Superman is an extremely moral person, believing it immoral to kill anyone under ' +
    'any circumstances, and will do whatever he can to avoid it. Clark\'s upbringing in ' +
    'the Midwest largely contributes to this, as his adoptive parents raised him to do the right thing. +\n' +
    'In Superman/Batman #3, Batman says, "It is a remarkable dichotomy. In many ways, Clark ' +
    'is the most human of us all. Then...he shoots fire from the skies, and it is difficult not ' +
    'to think of him as a god. And how fortunate we all are that it does not occur to him." \n' +
    'Superman is also a bit of a loner, in that, for much of his life, he doesn\'t reveal his ' +
    'true identity and powers to anyone, not even his closest friends. Many times they come ' +
    'close to figuring it out on their own, but often he will arrange an elaborate deception to ' +
    'trick them into believing Clark Kent and Superman are entirely separate. He\'s known ' +
    'to collect mementos of his adventures and his life in the Fortress of Solitude, and has ' +
    'even been known to have wax statues of all his friends there.'},

    name: 'Batman',
    realName: 'Bruce Wayne',
    heroImage: '../assets/images/batman.jpg',
    heroPortrait: '../assets/images/batman_nomask.jpg',
    shortBio: 'As a young child, Bruce Wayne watched his parents murdered before ' +
    'his eyes. Thomas and Martha Wayne were walking home from the Monarch ' +
    'Theater one night with their son, when they were held up at gunpoint by ' +
    'a mugger who demanded the pearl necklace that Martha was wearing. When Dr. ' +
    'Wayne refused to surrender it, both he and Martha were shot dead in the ' +
    'streets. The killer was a criminal known as Joe Chill. Fortunately, ' +
    'physician and social worker Leslie Thompkins was making a house call ' +
    'that night, and arrived to give loving comfort to the traumatized Bruce. He ' +
    'was then raised on the Wayne Manor estate, with help from the wise and ' +
    'loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Bruce had very few friends ' +
    'during his childhood.',
    bio: 'Batman\'s history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. ' +
    'Few elements of the character\'s history have remained constant. Scholars William ' +
    'Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional ' +
    'characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather ' +
    'existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character\'s origin story. As a ' +
    'little boy, Bruce Wayne is shocked to see his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne ' +
    'and his wife Martha Wayne, being murdered by a mugger in front of his very eyes. This ' +
    'drives him to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'A young Bruce Wayne can also be seen in his bedroom praying, strongly hinting ' +
    'him to be a Christian just like his Mother. Pearson and Uricchio also noted ' +
    'beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until ' +
    'recently, the fixed and occurring and hence, canonized, events have been few in ' +
    'number," a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as ' +
    'Dennis O\'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.'},

    name: 'Spider-man',
    realName: 'Peter Parker',
    heroImage: '../assets/images/spiderman.jpg',
    heroPortrait: '../assets/images/spiderman_nomask.jpg',
    shortBio: 'Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to Richard and Mary ' +
    'Parker. While Peter was still an infant, his parents were assigned ' +
    'by the CIA to infiltrate the Algerian based spy ring controlled by ' +
    'the communist agent, the Red Skull (Albert Malik). The moment the ' +
    'Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary were double agents, ' +
    'he had them killed by one of his agents, the Finisher, in an ' +
    'airplane crash overseas and then framed them for treason. ' +
    'Peter went to live with his uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker, ' +
    'in Forest Hills, New York; they became Peterâ€™s surrogate parents ' +
    'and raised him as if he were their own son. ',
    bio: 'While attending a public exhibition demonstrating the safe handling of nuclear ' +
    'laboratory waste materials, sponsored by the General Techtronics Corporation, ' +
    'the 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a spider that had been irradiated ' +
    'by a particle accelerator used in the demonstration. Unbeknownst to him, after the spider ' +
    'fell from his hand, it bit a girl, Cindy Moon on the ankle before it died from the radiation. ' +
    'Making his way home afterwards, Peter was almost hit by a car; when Peter jumped out of the ' +
    'way, Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and the ' +
    'ability to cling to walls, spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite. \n' +
    'Encountering an ad offering a cash prize for staying in the ring for three minutes ' +
    'with professional wrestler Joseph "Crusher" Hogan, Peter decided this ' +
    'would be a good way to test his powers. Wearing a mask to avoid potential ' +
    'embarrassment in case he lost the match, Peter easily defeated his opponent. ' +
    'TV producer Maxwell Shiffman observed his performance and convinced him to go on ' +
    'television with his \'act.\' Designing a full costume and fabricating a fluid ' +
    'similar to a spider\'s web and wrist-mounted web-shooters, Peter called himself ' +
    'Spider-Man, becoming an immediate sensation. \n' +
    'Following his first TV appearance, Peter failed to act to stop an escaping ' +
    'thief, claiming that it was not his responsibility to do so. Peter forgot the ' +
    'incident as his fame rose, but days later he returned home at night to find his ' +
    'Uncle Ben had been murdered. Learning the police had the burglar responsible holed ' +
    'up in a warehouse, Peter changed to Spider-Man and easily captured him only to discover ' +
    'he was the same thief he had allowed to escape earlier. Filled with remorse, he ' +
    'realized that when someone has power, he has an obligation to use it responsibly, ' +
    'so he decided to become a superhero.'},

    name: 'Iron Man',
    realName: 'Anthony "Tony" Stark',
    heroImage: '../assets/images/ironman.jpg',
    heroPortrait: '../assets/images/ironman_nomask.jpg',
    shortBio: 'Tony grew up completely unaware of ' +
    'Arno\'s existence or that he was adopted. While loved ' +
    'unconditionally by Maria, Tony suffered from a strained relationship ' +
    'with his father, both due to the constrast of Tony\'s sensitive ' +
    'and reclusive nature with Howard\'s glorification of physical prowess ' +
    'and Howard\'s ever-increasing drinking habits, which caused him to verbally ' +
    'abuse Tony and suffer from mood swings. This last factor caused ' +
    'Tony to turn to electronics as a coping mechanism at barely five years ' +
    'old, as he started to believe hardware to be comprehensible and reliable, ' +
    'whereas people were unpredictable and hard to understand. ' +
    'Tony\'s world couldn\'t find order, but the things he built did.',
    bio: 'Tony grew up completely unaware of Arno\'s existence or that he was adopted. ' +

    'and reliable, whereas people were unpredictable and hard to understand. ' +
    'Tony\'s world couldn\'t find order, but the things he built did. \n' +
    'In order to toughen his son, Howard sent Tony to boarding school at the age of seven, ' +
    'much to Maria\'s dismay. The following years, Tony learned of discipline of ' +
    'body and strength of character as Howard intended, while spending his free time ' +
    'reading alone. At the age of thirteen, the stories of Thomas Malory opened Tony ' +
    'the doors to a new world of dedication to a cause greater than oneself, of chivalry, ' +
    'honor, and armored heroes. \n' +
    'After boarding school, Tony joined an undergraduate program at MIT at the age of fifteen. ' +
    'He would effortlessly graduate as class valedictorian with double majors in physics and engineering. ' +
    'When he was seventeen, Tony met Meredith McCall, his first love and, unfortunately, ' +
    'the daughter of Howard\'s greatest business rival. Their relationship didn\'t develop ' +
    'beyond being a summer love, due to the combined interference of Meredith\'s father ' +
    'and Howard. Meredith was sent to live with relatives, and Tony was scheduled to go to ' +
    'Europe for education, with neither being told where the other was.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'The break-up was numbed by Tony\'s school routine at Cambridge University in England, ' +
    'where he met another girl named Cassandra Gillespie. Worse luck, Cassandra was also the ' +
    'daughter of a rival weapons manufacturer of Howard. Their relationship and Tony\'s ' +
    'attendance to Cambridge were both cut short by Howard, who believed the ' +
    'recently-established relationship to be nothing but a way for the Gillespies ' +
    'to get information on Howard through Tony. Tony doubted Howard and even tried to run ' +
    'away with Cassandra, but she eventually admitted that while she had fallen in ' +
    'love with Tony, their relationship did start as a ploy of her mother.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Around this time, Tony met Dr. Ted Slaght during a symposium. The physicist became a ' +
    'mentor to Stark, and taught him values beyond the importance of science, like the significance ' +
    'of guiding the search for knowledge with an ethical compass, and carrying an open mind.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Tony\'s mental dexterity caused him to drift into his 20\'s as shiftless thrill-seeker ' +
    'in the search for the challenges mundane life lacked. However, he would also lose interest ' +
    'of the dangerous hobbies he mastered, like skiing, parachuting and hang-gliding.'}
